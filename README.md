# Comparing-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-and-Traditional-Methods-for-Adaptive-Portfolio-Management

In this project, we will aim to provide a comparative analysis of Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms for optimizing algorithmic trading strategies; more specifically, Proximal Policy Optimization, Advantage Actor-Critic, and Deep Q-Networks. Our principal goal is to identify which deep learning architecture delivers superior risk-adjusted returns when applied to dynamic financial markets.  Moreover, to establish a performance benchmark, we will utilize traditional machine learning models such as gradient boosting machines and deep neural networks to provide further evaluation.  We will utilize historical price data, technical indicators (that is,is, MACD, RSI), and macroeconomic variables, as well as interest fluctuations, to create a robust trading environment. The models will be trained and tested across multiple different market regimes, bullish, bearish, and sideways, to allow a comprehensive assessment of adaptability and robustness. In addition, we will measure performance using key financial metrics such as the Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Maximum Drawdown, and annualized returns. In addition, this project will incorporate cost analysis to assess real-world trading viability and evaluate the impact of market volatility on algorithmic performance. The expected outcome of this project is to generate empirical insights into the comparative strengths and limitations of each algorithm, which will offer practical guidance for developing robust data-driven trading strategies in dynamic financial environments.
